// Student Grades Tracker (Array with Names and Grades)
/* What it does:
   * Takes input for the names of 5 students.
   * Takes input for their grades.
   * Displays each studentâ€™s name with their grade.
   * Calculates and displays the average grade for all students. */

/* What Happens in This Program?
    Arrays for Student Names and Grades:
        students[5] stores the names of 5 students.
        grades[5] stores the grades of the 5 students.

    User Input:
        The program asks the user to input the grades for each student one by one.
        We store each grade in the grades array.

    Total and Average:
        We calculate the total sum of all the grades by adding each grade to a variable called total.
        Then, we calculate the average by dividing the total by 5 (the number of students).

    Display Information:
        The program displays each student's name along with their grade.
        It also displays the average grade for all students.

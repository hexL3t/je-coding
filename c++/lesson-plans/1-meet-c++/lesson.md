# Lesson 1: Meet C++ -- Our Coding Toolbox
## 🎯 Lesson Goal
Learn the basic structure of a C++ program and how to run it!

## 🔧 What is C++?
* A powerful programming language used in robotics, games, apps, and more.
* With C++, you give the computer step-by-step instructions.

## 🔧 C++ File Structure
Like other languages, C++ has a special way to save their files.

Let's practice our program structure and file structure together! 


Create a new file and call it something like: 
```my-first-program.cpp```

Make sure to end it with ```.cpp```!

## 🧱 C++ Program Structure
``` c++
 #include <iostream>    // Lets us use input/output tools
using namespace std;   	// Makes writing code easier

int main() {           	// Main function – the heart of the program
	cout << "Hello!";  	// Print message to screen
	return 0;          	// End the program
}
```
## 🧠 Break It Down: What’s What?

| Code                            | What it does                       |
| -------------                   | -------------                      |
| ``` #include <iostream> ```     | Adds tools to print on the screen  | 
| ``` using namespace std; ```    | Adds tools to print on the screen  | 
| ``` int main() {   ```          | Starts the program                 | 
| ``` cout << "Hello!";  ```      | Displays text on screen            | 
| ``` return 0;   ```             | Ends the program successfully      | 
| ``` }   ```                     | Closes the main function           | 

## 💡 Mini Project: Hello You!
``` c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	cout << "Hello, my name is Alex!" << endl;
	cout << "Fun fact: I love space!" << endl;
	return 0;
}
```

### ✍️ Task:
Write a program that says hello and shares a fun fact about YOU!

### ✏️ Student Worksheet: Fill in the Code
Fill in the blanks to make your program!

## 🔍 Label the Program
Match each part of this code to its purpose:
| Code                            | Labels to Match   |
| -------------                   | -------------     |
| ``` #include <iostream> ```     | 1. Main Function  | 
| ``` using namespace std ```     | 2. Print Statement  | 
| ``` int main() { ```     | 3. End of Program  | 
| ``` cout << "I like Pizza!" << endl; ```     | 4. Include Tools  | 
| ``` return 0; ```     | 5. Use Standard Library  | 
| ``` } ```     | 5. Use Standard Library  |

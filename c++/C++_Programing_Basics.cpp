// ---- C++ Programing Basics ----
/* C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed by
   Bjarne Stroustrup as an enhancement of the C language to add 
   object-oriented paradigm. 
*/

// Features of C++
/* The main features C++ programming language are as follows:
    - Simple : Broken down into logical units and parts, with a rich
               library support and a variety of datatypes.
    - Machine Independent : C++ can be run on any machine (suitable compiler)
    - Low-Level Access: System programming and writing efficient code
    - Fast Execution Speed: One of the fastest high-level languages (short processing)
    - Object-Oriented: Object-Oriented support helps make maintainble 
                        and extensible programs.
                        eg. large-scale applications
*/

// Applications of C++
/* C++ is used in a wide range of applications:
    - Gaming Engines: Unreal Engine, Source 2
    - Operating Systems: Windows and Linux
    - Application Software: Microsoft Office, and Adobe Photoshop
    - Embedded Systems: Arduino, and Raspberry PI
    - Real-time Systems: VxWorks and RTOS

# Project Word Scramble
## 🔥 Project Overview:

In this project, you’ll create a Word Scramble Game where the computer randomly picks a word, scrambles the letters, and challenges the player to guess the original word!

This fun, brain-teasing game helps students master essential programming skills like string manipulation, randomness, loops, input/output, and function design.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered:
* **Strings & Lists:** Breaking apart and rebuilding words.
* **Random Module:** Shuffling letters and selecting words.
* **Functions:** Organizing code into reusable parts.
* **Loops & Conditionals:** Repeating guesses and checking correctness.
* **User Input:** Accepting and responding to player actions.

## 🧩 Core Tasks:
✅ Create a word list and randomly choose one word.

✅ Write a function to scramble the letters.

✅ Let the user guess the unscrambled word.

✅ Track the number of attempts.

✅ Add a replay option so the game can be played again.

## 🧪 What the Game Does:
* Picks a random word from a list.
* Scrambles the letters in a fun and challenging way.
* Prompts the user to guess the original word.
* Gives feedback on correct or incorrect guesses.
* Tracks how many attempts were made.

# 🚀 Extension: Smarter Scramble Mode

Let’s level up your game!
## ✨ Features in this extension:
1. **💡 Hint System** – Type 'hint' to get the first letter of the word!
2. **⏱️ Time Tracker**– See how long it takes you to guess correctly.
3. **🏆 Scoreboard** – Keeps track of your best attempt count and fastest time!

## ✏️ Summary:

You created a brain-teasing word game that:
* Scrambles letters using Python tools like random.shuffle().
* Takes user input and loops until the correct guess is made.
* Tracks and displays score, time, and hints.

You practiced working with:
* Strings and lists
* Functions
* Loops and conditionals
* Randomness and timers
* Problem-solving with feedback!

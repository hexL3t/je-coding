# 🧠 Word Scramble Game – Teacher's Guide

This project introduces students to core Python concepts through a fun, interactive game that scrambles words and challenges them to guess the original.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of the lesson, students will be able to:
- Use Python functions and loops
- Implement conditional logic and user input
- Work with strings and lists
- Apply randomness using the `random` module
- Extend functionality with timers, hint systems, and score tracking

## 🧰 Files

- `basic_scramble.py`: The starter version of the game
- `extended_scramble.py`: Includes hint system, timer, and scoreboard
- `lesson.md`: Teaching notes and key programming concepts

## 🕒 Suggested Lesson Plan (60 Minutes)

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 5 min | Introduction and demo of the game |
| 10 min | Review the basic version line-by-line |
| 15 min | Students modify or complete the basic game |
| 20 min | Introduce and explain the extended features |
| 5 min | Students play, compare scores |
| 5 min | Wrap-up: review key concepts & discuss possible extensions |

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Functions (`def`)
- Loops (`while`)
- Conditionals (`if`, `else`)
- User Input (`input()`)
- Strings & Lists
- Modules: `random`, `time`
- Code readability and commenting
- Problem-solving and debugging

## 🧩 Optional Challenges

- Add a scoreboard that saves to a file
- Add levels with longer or trickier words
- Create a 2-player version
- Let users add their own word list

## 🧑‍🏫 Tips for Teachers

- Encourage collaboration and testing
- Prompt students to explain code sections aloud
- Let students customize the word list with topic-relevant vocabulary
- Reinforce debugging as a positive process

import random  # Import the random module for word selection and shuffling

# Step 1: Create a list of words to use in the game
word_list = ['python', 'coding', 'programming', 'debug', 'function', 'variable']

# Step 2: Define a function that scrambles the letters of a word

    return ''.join(word_letters)  # Join the characters back into a string

# Step 3: Define the game logic in a function

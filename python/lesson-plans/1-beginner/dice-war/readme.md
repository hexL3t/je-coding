# 🌟 Project 2: Dice War (Mini-Game)
## 🔥 Project Overview:
In this project, you will create a Dice Battle Royale game where you and the CPU roll dice and compete across multiple rounds!

You will learn how to work with random numbers, use loops, make decisions with conditionals, and track scores with variables.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered:
* **Random Numbers:** How to simulate dice rolls.
* **Loops:** Playing multiple rounds automatically.
* **Conditionals:** Deciding who wins each round.
* **Variables:** Keeping track of player and CPU scores.

## 🧩 Challenge:
✅ Create a function to roll a dice.

✅ Play a quick match (1 roll each).

✅ Build a full 5-round battle with a final winner.

✅ Bonus: Let users adjust the number of rounds!

## 🧹 What the Dice Battle Code Does:
* Rolls a dice for the player and the CPU.
* Adds up the results for each player.
* Compares scores and awards points each round.
* Shows a final scoreboard to declare the champion!


# 🎯 Extension: Ultimate Battle Mode

What if you want bigger or crazier battles?

This extension upgrades your game to support more rounds, more dice, and bonus point rules!

## ✍️ How Ultimate Battle Works:
1. Allows the player to choose how many rounds they want to play.
2. Rolls extra dice or applies bonus scoring (example: double points if you roll two sixes).
3. Keeps track of all rounds and shows detailed results.

# ✏️ Summary:

You built a mini battle arena where:
* Players roll dice and compete round by round.
* Points are tracked and winners are announced.
* You practiced random numbers, loops, and scorekeeping!

# 💡 Extra Challenges (TO BE LOOKED INTO):

🔢 Allow players to choose 1, 2, or 3 dice per roll.

🎯 Bonus Points: Give 2x points for rolling doubles (two of the same number)!

🧹 Streak Tracker: Count how many rounds each player wins in a row!

🎨 UI Upgrade: Build a simple scoreboard with ASCII art or even graphics using libraries like pygame!

# CODE-AN-ADVENTURE
# Cyber Safari: Code Your Escape!

# Story Prompt:
# You're on a school field trip to the prestigious Technos Institute, a cutting-edge research facility
# known for its incredible virtual reality simulations. Today's adventure: a cyber safari through the
# heart of a digital jungle!Â But something goes wrong. The simulation malfunctions, trapping you
# inside the program.
# Here's where your coding skills come in! You need to solve puzzles and write Python code to navigate
# the virtual jungle, escape dangers, and find your way back to the real world.

# Intermediate / Advanced

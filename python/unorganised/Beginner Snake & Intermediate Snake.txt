Beginner Snake & Intermediate Snake VS Advanced Snake

Here are the key differences:

Control Scheme:
Advanced Snake: Uses both WASD and arrow keys for control.
Beginner/Intermediate: Uses only arrow keys.

Scoring System:
Advanced Snake: Implements a scoring system with a visible score display.
Beginner/Intermediate: Doesn't have a scoring system.

Game Speed:
Attached game: Increases speed as the score increases.
Beginner/Intermediate: Maintains a constant speed.

Screen Setup:
Attached game: Uses a 600x600 window.
Beginner/Intermediate: Uses a 400x400 window.

Game Over Mechanics:
Attached game: Has a kill_snake() function that turns segments red, then hides them before resetting.
Beginner/Intermediate: Simply resets the snake to the starting position without visual effects.

Collision Detection:
Attached game: Checks for collisions with walls and self.
Beginner/Intermediate: Only checks for collisions with walls.

Food Size:
Attached game: Uses a smaller food size (0.5, 0.5).
Beginner/Intermediate: Uses the default size for food.

Snake Growth:
Attached game: Creates new segments by cloning the head.
Beginner/Intermediate: Creates new segments as separate turtles.


Movement Logic:
Attached game: Updates segment positions in the move() function.
Beginner/Intermediate: Updates segment positions in the main game loop.


Variable Names and Structure:

The attached game uses different variable names (e.g., snake_win vs screen).
The overall structure and organization of functions differ slightly.


Error in Direction Setting:

The attached game has an error in the move_right and move_left functions, where the directions are reversed.


Game Loop:

The attached game uses a while playing loop with a delay variable.
Our game uses an infinite while True loop with time.sleep().



The attached game is more feature-rich, with scoring, progressive difficulty, and better visual feedback for game over. However, it also contains a bug in the left/right movement functions. Our game is simpler but lacks some of these advanced features.

# Pizza Order Calculator ---
# This task will introduce you to working with numbers,
# user input, and basic calculations in Python.

# Objective:  Create a program that calculates the total
# cost of a pizza order.

# Steps:
# 1. Define pizza prices: Set variables for the prices of different
# pizza sizes (small, medium, large) and toppings (extra cheese,
# pepperoni, etc.).
# 2. Get user input: Use loops and input() to ask the user for:
#					- Pizza size (small, medium, large)
#					- Number of toppings they want
#					- Whether they want extra cheese
#    (yes/no) for each topping
# 3. Calculate base price: Use conditional statements (if/else)
#    to determine the base price based on the chosen size.
# 4. Calculate topping price: Multiply the number of toppings by
#    the base topping price (add extra cost for extra cheese).
# 5. Calculate total price: Add the base price and the topping price.
# 6. Print the order summary: Display the chosen size, number of
#    toppings, and the final order price.

# Bonus:
# - Allow the user to choose from a list of pre-defined pizzas
#   with specific toppings and prices.
# - Implement a discount for orders with a certain number of toppings.
# - Display the order in a user-friendly format with proper labels
#   for each item.

# Tips:
# - Use descriptive variable names to improve code readability.
# - Break down the calculations into smaller steps for better understanding.
# - Test your code with different pizza sizes and topping combinations
#   to ensure accurate pricing.

# This task will help you practice working with variables,
# performing basic calculations, and using conditional statements in Python.
# Go forth and create the ultimate pizza ordering program!

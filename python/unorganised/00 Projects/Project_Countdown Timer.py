# Countdown Timer!
# For this project, you will create a Python program that acts like a simple countdown timer!
# You tell it how many seconds until launch, and it will tick down the time for you.

# You'll use the 'input' function to ask the user to enter the number of seconds for the countdown.
# Convert the user's input from text to a number using int.
# Store the number of seconds in a variable.

# Use a while loop to keep the countdown running until the timer reaches zero.
# Inside the loop, you'll use the time module's sleep function to pause the program for one second.

# During each loop, calculate the remaining time by subtracting one second from the initial launch time.
# Use string formatting or f-strings to create a nicely formatted time display showing minutes and seconds (hint: use integer division and modulo operator).
# Print the remaining time to the console.

# Once the loop finishes (because the timer hits zero), print a message like "Blastoff!" to celebrate the launch.

# Bonus Challenge:
# Can you modify the program to display the countdown in a more exciting way?
# Hint: Use conditional statements to print different messages as the timer gets closer to launch (e.g., "10 seconds to launch!", "Ignition sequence started!")

# You've got this!
# You need to import a libary, what library will we need if we are dealing with time?
